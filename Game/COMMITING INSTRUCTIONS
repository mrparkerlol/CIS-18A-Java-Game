Hello fellow project peeps!

You were redirected by me to read this...

We should all follow this in order to keep things from collapsing.

- Instead of immediately merging your own commits, create a pull request to prevent things from breaking.
    We will all reach a consensus on merging pull requests before doing so.
    (Create your own branch for making changes by following this: https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html#branch
    and ONLY commit to that branch for the entirety of the project)
- Use consistent styling
    - camelCase for variables
    - UpperCase for classes
    - keep variables inside functions/other local to those if possible
        If a variable is only used in a for loop or a function, keep it inside it.
    - No global variables (if possible)
        If you need to, use a class instead - that's what I do and I pass it as a function argument
- Make frequent pulls on the repo - to prevent potentially pushing an out of date build by accident
- Make sure your changes work fully, and don't push a broken change unless you absolutely need to for help
- Make sure you don't push .exe files or any of that - keep the repo only filled with source files
- Don't clutter the repo with useless files - everything should be used in the project and if it isn't being used - delete it.

Make sure you add yourself to the Info file in order to get credited for your work. Plug an email, handle, or what have you with your name.
Make sure to follow my example in README.md in order to properly receive credit, and to make it easier for John to see who did what.
